# mountain-kelvin-labs
The simple UI to interact with API from Mountain Kelvin Guestroom Management System
## Tech stack
This codebase is built from Nodejs framework and React library
I do not use create-react-app because that may cause troubles in the package.json file later on. Also, the 'convenient' syntax may restrict you from modifying 
your webpack config file and babelrc in the future (For ex: You have separate database for testing and production)
